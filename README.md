# CRT Hangman  
*A Terminal-Based Hangman Game with Retro CRT Glow*

This is a classic **Hangman** game rebuilt with a twist â€” styled to look and feel like itâ€™s running on an old green-screen CRT monitor from the 1980s. No modern UI, no graphics â€” just blinking scanlines, phosphor glow effects, and chunky ASCII borders.  

Gameplay is simple, but the presentation is everything.

## âœ¨ Features

- CRT-styled terminal UI using `colorama` (green-on-black, blinking glow, ASCII borders)
- Classic Hangman logic with a hand-picked vocabulary list
- Custom `crt_refresh_effect()` to simulate scanline-style rendering
- Dynamic game screen with status updates, visual hangman stages, and interactive messages
- Written entirely in **Python** â€” no external libraries beyond `colorama`
- Runs in any terminal that supports ANSI codes (Windows, Mac, Linux)

## ðŸ¤– AI Credit

This project was built with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Claude** â€” the real powerhouses behind the code.  
I just supplied the idea and tuned the aesthetics (although there isn't much to direct here...); they handled the logic, styling, and screen architecture.
